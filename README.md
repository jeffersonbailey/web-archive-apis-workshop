## Scripts and such for workshops on web archive APIs ##

Scripts and descriptions of what they do, culled from daily practice in my daily practices of work and fun and too-much-time-on-my-hands. Credit to the Archive-It and Internet Archive folks that sometimes help me with the harder parts I can't find on Stack Overflow.

See also https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop because all this stuff will eventually live together in a harmonious fashion.
